# Prosperity Prognosticator: Machine Learning for Startup Success Prediction

Prosperity Prognosticator is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts the success probability of a startup based on 76 real-world features. It is designed to assist entrepreneurs, investors, and analysts in evaluating startup potential using data-driven insights.

## Project Overview

This project integrates the complete machine learning lifecycle with a web deployment interface:

- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (univariate and multivariate)
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Model building using Random Forest Classifier
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics
- Web application development using Flask
- Frontend interface for user input and result visualization
- REST API for programmatic access
- Interactive HTML templates and a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Jinja2 templates
- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Deployment**: Localhost or compatible cloud hosting (Render, Railway, etc.)
